# Deep Learning Architecture Comparison: VGG, ResNet, and GoogLeNet on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100

## Project Overview
This project evaluates the performance of three popular deep learning architectures—**VGG**, **ResNet**, and **GoogLeNet**—on three different image datasets: **MNIST**, **CIFAR-10**, and **CIFAR-100**. The primary objective is to analyze and compare these models based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Repository Contents

- **Code/**
  - `Comparison_VGG_ResNet_GoogLeNet.py`: Main Python script for implementing and running the model experiments.

- **Evidences/**
  - **Training and Loss Logs/**: Directory which stores training logs for each model and dataset combination.
  - **Classified Images/**: Directory containing images that show predictions for each model.

## Requirements

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- PIL

To install the required libraries, you can run:
